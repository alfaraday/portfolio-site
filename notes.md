## The Bad & The Ugly

- The color palette selected by chatGPT was ugly: 
| Section      | Color Description  | Hex       |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------- |
| Landing Page | Light Blue         | `#f0f8ff` |
| About Me     | Cornsilk           | `#fff8dc` |
| Sample Work  | Light Gray         | `#f5f5f5` |
| Experience   | Very Light Cyan    | `#e6f7ff` |
| Reach Out    | Linen (pale cream) | `#faf0e6` |

- Despite requesting social icons in the original prompt, used text links. Updated on second request, but the GitHub icon was broken.
- The original experience text included weird content-reference errors.
- The experience text on both first and second skips my current job and includes incorrect info for some roles and my degreee from NYU
