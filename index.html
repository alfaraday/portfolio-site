                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Staff Unqork Engineer with a background in product ownership, operations, and education. I have years of experience leading both client-facing and internal no-code engineering teams in the delivery of user-friendly enterprise web applications. Prior to joining Unqork as an Engineer, I oversaw the development of online coding courses for Thinkful (acquired by Chegg) on both the Product and Operations sides of the company.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I'm busy bedazzling Red Bull cans, reading fantasy novels, and caring for a small goblin dog.</p>

                    <p>
                    As a member of Unqork's UDesigner team, I currently use the firm's proprietary no-code platform to build its own IDE. In this position, I have contributed to a complete rebuild of the product's frontend and the development of new features like Branch & Merge and Version Control. I have also lead discovery on Agentic features using Google's Gemini LLM.

                    I have also served as a Lead Engineer for Unqork's client delivery team, building enterprise web applications for our customers. In this position I lead development on insurance software and helped to secure our first federal government contract. As a lead, I conducted discovery sessions with clients, created project timelines, wrote user stories, ran agile ceremonies (daily stand-up, refinement, sprint planning, and retro), and performed sprint demos.

                    I also created and ran an onboarding program for new engineers, improving new hire success and retention. I managed one direct report and mentored multiple junior engineers.

In this role, I also built automation tools, decreasing time to publish by 30% (Node.js and Python).
